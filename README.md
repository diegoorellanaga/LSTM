## LSTM Explained

The end goal of this document is to explain LSTM by relating it to the simple feedforward NN case. We do this by comparing LSTM with a feedforward NN. We will explain the parameters and dimension of the paremeters related to LSTM. We use keras with tensorflow for the examples.

### LSTM Review
